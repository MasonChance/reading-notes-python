#Regex.

short for regular expressions; these are used to identify key components (usually a string) by their pattern. sometimes when you are looking for something within the whole of a file or other string type input you don't know exactly what you want, only the pattern that it follows. pattern can be based on the character type, a range of characters, groups of characters, a specific character that follows what you are searching for and many others. for quick reference to basic regex pattern indicators, see the [tutorial summary table](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-regular-expression-tutorial#table) in the tutorial section of the datacamp.com website

A key thing to remember when cconstruction a regex pattern for use: always be aware of, and intentional about weather your pattern is greedy (matching everythign possible) or non-greedy(matching as little as possible. usually to the first instance of a match).
