# Django 
at first blush, Django is a server setup/run package allowing devs to create interactive front-end websites with a python backend. similarily to Nodejs / Nodemon for Javascript it also seems to have an onboard view-engine in lieu of Express.

Django is a web-framework that is opensource and maintained by a small handful of dedicated devs that coordinate the contributions and discussisons from other contributors.
