# Stack and Queue

To stack is the exact opposite of what one would do in a restaurant. the last in is the first out  and the first in is the last out. no expiration dates to wory about here. below are the standard operations that relate to a Stack: 
  - **Push** add to the stack (like an island deck in Magic the Gathering, just add another instant to the top of the stack)
  - **Pop** resolve the top (as with push, this happens when the blue player says "I'll allow it")
  - **Top** the opposite of bottom (don't you love when a word actually means the same thing as it's definition)
  - **Peek** basically the scry ability, also common in island decks, always tryna see what you have next
  - **IsEmpty** ah finally something else that actually is as it seems. check that the stack is not empty before performing other operations

The Queue is to Brits what getting in line is to Americans. Remember your food service training, FirstInFirstOut. there are similar basic operations for a queue and forgettign them is often a good way to step on toes. 

  - **Enqueue** Get in Line.
  - **Dequeue** your number has been called please proceed to the next available attendent
  - **Front** the person that gets help next.
  - **Rear** Line Starts Here!
  - **Peek** aboo. the electronic board at the DMV pointing to the next person that will get "assistance"
  - **IsEmpty** while the DMV is never actually empty you'd probably better check the queue before attempting the above operations. 

Thank you for enduring my vague analogies, if you have questions please form up on the queue and we will assist you ass soon as we clear the current stack of forms.
